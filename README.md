# SABHA
Home automation has been a booming industry providing different solutions for the consumers, World’s top Techgaints like Google, amazon and even Facebook 
are being heavily investing in Home automation, knowing that it is the next basic need of the future. They have introduced Home automation solutions like 
Alexa by Amazon, Google Home by Google Corp and Jarvis by Facebook. But, these are constrained only to few nations due to lack of technological 
developments in other nations and due to its high cost of implementation. There by a low cost search assistant based home automation system is yet to be 
introduced.

# OBJECTIVE

The main objective, to build a low cost search assistant based home automation system. The system mainly consists of two modules: The Master Module 
(which is an raspberry pi based search assistant module) and Control Module (which is like a switch board cover used to control the appliances). In 
addition to these there is an OLED Display for the consumer to know other useful information like time, date, weather and even ring an alarm. Thereby 
without using any kind of PLC or any other high cost controllers to control the action of the switches to provide a low cost search assistant based home 
automation solution for the consumer.
  
# MOTIVATION
In order to improve the quality of life for common people, in these work we focused on developing new technologies to help these persons to access the \
home appliances from any outdoor environment. With an exponential growth of relatively old concept of home automation, the installation of the system and 
managing it are still very complex to deal with. In this project we are creating a simple way to manage multiple end points by the average user using 
Voice recognition. The system intends to help them in providing the information using internet. This solution can be used in various sectors for making 
daily tasks comfortable and easy.
            
# PROPOSED SYSTEM
The Master Module takes the speech signal as the input and gives a speech signal as an output thereby performing actions of a search assistant (like
surfing the web, setting alarms, etc.,) , it also gives an output to the control module to control home appliances(commands like: ”switch on the light”). 
The Control Module is in form of a switch board cover with some projection accompanying some electronic components and servo motors that are used to \
control the switching action of the switches.
